# CelluLink
Software package for vertex-based tissue modelling

OnewayCoupling.py : Script for a 2D apical vertex model with Ca2+ signalling. Only Ca2+ affects cell mechanics and not vice versa.
TwowayCoupling.py : Script for a 2D apical vertex model with Ca2+ signalling. Two-way feedback between Ca2+ and cell mechanics.

To simulate a model, simply download and run the script.

Future update
-------------
Repo to be updated \
CelluLink to be implemented as a Python package \
Functions within the scripts to be implemented as modules \
Import functions from modules into main.py \
Run main.py \
